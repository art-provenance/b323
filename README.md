README B323

Data provided by the Bundesarchiv Koblenz (EAD XML) related to the collection B323 has been worked on recently.

2022-02-07: BArachB323-NER-2022-02-04.dump

The first dataset contains the basic graph, that is EAD XML transformed into neo4J.

We applied Goolge NER to enrich the graph. You might check out a first version as neo4j dump (version 4.4.2).
Please note, there has been no disambiguation yet.

In addition to NER, we added some nodes manually. These are related to research topics: a few persons, organizations and storage locations. We have drawn up a list of about 60 locations, which have been used as art depots for looted art and museum property during WWII and which are mentioned in B323 descriptions.
